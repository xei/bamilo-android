    <!-- Because the build system was not detecting the drawable as being used by the app,
 because its only used by the Ad4push SDK, the shrinkResources task was removing this at build time,
 causing the app to crash when it received a notification.
 The shrinkResource task also removes the resources not being used from the libraries, so we have to
 keep the xml's files in order to be able to show the in app messages.
 The above lines lets the build system know to keep those resources even if it they are marked as unused.-->
